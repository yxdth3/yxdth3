- 👋 Hi, I’m @yxdth3
- 👀 I’m interested in a data analysis,  I like to be constantly learning and I do it effectively and constantly. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Digital Marketing, reinforcing languages ​​such as JavaScript and the use of Power BI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on in a job that tests my knowledge and gives me the ability to learn even more.
